# SpotleAI---Heart-Attack-Predictor-Project
Build a heart attack predictor based on past diagnostic data of patients using a machine learning model such as Logistic Regression 

The dataset consists of diagnostically measured parameters and the actual case of heart attack along each set of measured parameters. This dataset will be used to train and test our predictor model.

The enclosed file has Python code for the logistic regression model to predict heart attack. Model has been trained using 70% of the data in the given dataset and tested with remaining 30% of the data

Used techniques like hyperparameter optimization to get the best combination of features for the model.
